This project was done in order to create an app that gives the user an overall idea of their device connectivity.
It uses Java as its primary language and provides an interface to the user where the user has to provide a URL in this format.
URL format example  --- >>   https://google.com      OR   http://www.google.com.
The app will then provide the user with information about the device connectivity such as :
 1. Whether the device is connected to the internet or not
 2. If it is connected via 'mobile-data' or 'wi-fi'
 3. If the URL provided is a valid URL or not (by format according to URI reference as defined by RFC 2396: Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax)
 4. Ping the provided URL and get a Response code and match it with pre-set conditions to diplay the corresponding message.
The info will be shown in cards in the app and can be removed as well.
